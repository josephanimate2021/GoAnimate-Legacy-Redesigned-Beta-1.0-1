# GoAnimate Legacy Redesigned
## What is it?
a GoAnimate Server Emulator which is built with Node.JS. This project was originally supposed to bring back the original GoAnimate servers. Because this project is old and my code was crappy a few years ago, it will not make a great alt to FlashThemes and this project is considered unusable.
## NOTE:
This LVM Project is outdated. This means that this lvm project will not be a good alt to FlashThemes and our team at GoNexus will not be working on this project any time soon.
